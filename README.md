# OpenFoam-Example
This is an example of the openfoam files used to run simulations. The only difference between this example and the code used to simulate wings is the constant/polyMesh folder, which normally contains the mesh that represents the wing but was removed from this example due to Githubâ€™s file size limitation.

For information about the project itself, read Aero IP Report. It includes an explanation of the computational analysis done for this project as well as images of the results of the aerodynamic simulations.
